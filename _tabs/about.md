Hi, I’m luqii, a full-time bug bounty hunter since 2020, passionate about uncovering vulnerabilities and contributing to a safer digital world. My journey into ethical hacking started with curiosity and it quickly grew into a profession I love.

I specialize in web application security, API testing, and creative bug-hunting techniques. Over the years, I’ve worked with various platforms through HackerOne, uncovering critical vulnerabilities and helping secure some of the internet's most essential services.

When I’m not hacking, I’m probably spending time with animals or gaming—two of my favorite ways to relax. Whether it’s finding creative solutions in security or connecting with furry friends, I’m always drawn to things that challenge or inspire me.
